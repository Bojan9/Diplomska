# Decentralized Trust Management in Cloud Environments

This repository contains the source code for an application developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis at the **University of Ljubljana**, Faculty of Computer and Information Science.

## 📘 Thesis Title

**Application of Decentralized Identifiers in Trusted Cloud Environments**

## 🛠 About the Project

The project demonstrates a decentralized trust management system using:

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** – for secure, self-sovereign identity
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** – for reputation representation
- **Reputation Trust Models** – combining direct, contextual, and indirect scoring
- **Cloud-IoT Scenario** – simulating trusted interaction between cloud services and edge devices

The app is built using:

- **Frontend**: React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (development)

## 📖 Features

- DID registration and management
- Verifiable credential issuance & verification
- Reputation trust calculation
- Voting and feedback for entities
- Admin dashboard for managing trust layers

## 🏫 University

This work was completed under the supervision of prof. dr. Vlado Stankovski and doc. dr. Petar Kochovski, as a graduation requirement for the **Bachelor's in Computer Science** at the **University of Ljubljana**.
